# Quickstart

Welcome to the Bridge documentation!

If you have any questions about anything related to Bridge or if you want to discuss with us and the community, you are welcome to join our **[discord](https://discord.gg/yxjrwm7Bfr)**.

## Autimatic Setup

We recommend creating a new Bridge app using `create-bridge-app`, which sets up everything automatically for you. (You don't need to create an empty directory, `create-bridge-app` will make one for you.) To create a project, run:

```bash
npx create-bridge-app@latest
# or
yarn create bridge-app
# or
pnpm create bridge-app
```

After the installation is complete:

- Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev` to start the development server on `http://localhost:8080`
- Edit `index.ts` to start developing your server

For more information on how to use create-next-app, you can review the create-bridge-app [documentation](https://discord.gg/yxjrwm7Bfr).

## Manual Setup

Install `bridge` in your project:

```bash
npm install bridge
# or
yarn add bridge
# or
pnpm add bridge
```

### Defining an endpoint

Let's walk through the steps of building a typesafe API with Bridge. To start, let's create an endpoint that returns "Hello World" to the client.

```ts twoslash title='index.ts'
import { handler } from 'bridge';

const helloEndpoint = handler({
  resolve: () => 'Hello World',
});
```

A handler can set an endpoint and validate user data such as the body, files, request parameters or headers sent. Check out how it works in detail [here](handler/resolve).

### Defining the routes

To define the routes of our project, we simply have to create a routes object and insert inside our handlers. The keys of the routes object correspond to the path.

```ts twoslash title='index.ts'
import { handler } from 'bridge';

const helloEndpoint = handler({
  resolve: () => 'Hello World',
});

const routes = {
  hello: helloEndpoint,
};
```

### Launching the server

To launch our server code, we need to initiate our bridge project with `initBridge`.

**Complete Bridge App with HTTP**

```ts twoslash title='index.ts' showLineNumbers
import { handler, initBridge } from 'bridge';

const helloEndpoint = handler({
  resolve: () => 'Hello World',
});

const routes = {
  hello: helloEndpoint,
};

const port = 8080;

initBridge({ routes })
  .HTTPServer()
  .listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
  });
```

**Complete Bridge App with Express**

```ts twoslash title='index.ts' showLineNumbers
import { handler, initBridge } from 'bridge';
import express from 'express';

const routes = {
  hello: handler({
    resolve: () => 'Hello World',
  }),
};

const port = 8080;
const app = express();

app.use('', initBridge({ routes }).expressMiddleware());

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

You can test your endpoint by making an http call to `http://localhost:8080/hello`.

Congratulations, you just launched your first bridge server! ðŸ¥³

## Client code generation and documentation

You'll soon be able to generate automatically a complete documentation and a fully type sdk of your api in any language with the Bridge App.

Coming soon...
