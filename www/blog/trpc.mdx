We often are asked how Bridge is different from trpc.
- Bridge API can be used just like traditional REST API's

## Client
The Bridge client is generated: which means there is a compilation time 
The trpc/client can be instantanlly used: there is no build time. It's updates are instant

This leads to indirect differences: 
- trpc requires the backend and frontend repo on the same machine 

## DX
Bridge can be used using objects or classes.

trpc is more functional (it means chaining methods)...

Here is the same request with Bridge and trpc

Bridge:

```ts
import { z } from "zod"
import { handler, initBridge } from 'bridge';

const helloHandler = handler({
  body: z.object({ name: z.string() }),
  resolve: ({ body }) => `Hello ${body.name}`
})

const routes = { hello: helloHandler };

const httpServer = initBridge({ routes }).HTTPServer();

httpServer.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Trpc:

```ts
import { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';
import { createHTTPServer } from '@trpc/server/adapters/standalone';

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;

const t = initTRPC.create();

const publicProcedure = t.procedure;
const router = t.router;

const appRouter = router({
  greet: publicProcedure
    .input(z.object({ name: z.string() }))
    .query(({ input }) => ({ greeting: `hello, ${input}!` })),
});

createHTTPServer({
  router: appRouter,
  createContext() {
    return {};
  },
}).listen(2022);
```
